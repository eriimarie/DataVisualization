# Netflix User Engagement
Description
  I created a data visualization model analyzing Netflix user engagement, focusing on key metrics like age, watch time, and subscription year. The process starts with exploratory data analysis (EDA), identifying missing values, followed by the Simultaneous Marginal Confidence Sequence for data plotting with confidence bands.

Key visualizations include scatterplots for watch time vs. age, and watch time vs. gender, segmented by genres (drama, comedy, action). Further analysis includes various scatterplots showcasing relationships between age, year, watch time, and subscription. The final component is a seaborn pair plot, illustrating user ID, age, watch time, year, and subscription for a more detailed overview.
